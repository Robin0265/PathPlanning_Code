# Sampling-based Mobile Robot Path Planning Algorithm by Dijkstra, Astar and Dynamic Programming

In this repository, we briefly presented full source code of Dijkstra, Astar and Dynamic Programming approach to find best route from starting node to end node on 2D graph. We also provide a main script which performs these algorithms on given map.

## Map Definiton
We already provide a sample map creatin in map_definition.m source code. We defined all closed polygon in that maps which shows the obstacles. In sample map, there are 13 different obstances whose edges are defined by given x and y corordinate. One sample is shown by followings;
```
map.pgx{1}=[2 8.5 8.5 4 2 2 1 1 2 4 2];
map.pgy{1}=[8 10 1 3 3 1 1 6 6 5 8];
```
